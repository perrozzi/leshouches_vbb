\subsection{Introduction}

The vector boson production in association with one and two b jets at the
CERN Large Hadron Collider is important for many different experimental and
theoretical reasons. Bottom quarks have a peculiar signature which allows one
to easily identify them thanks to a displaced decay vertex. The associated
production with vector bosons is an important backgrounds to VH production
with the Higgs boson decaying to b quarks, and many new physics
searches. Theoretically, it offers an interesting testing ground for
predictions involving heavy quarks.

There are two possible options for the calculation of processes with b-quarks
in the final state at hadron colliders. In the four-flavour scheme (4F)
b-quarks are not present in the parton density of the incident protons. They
can only be generated in the final state and they are usually massive. In the
five-flavour scheme (5F) the b-quark mass is considered small with respect to
the scale of the process $Q$ and powers of logarithms of the type
$\log\frac{Q^2}{m_b^2}$ are resummed into a b parton density function. The
b-quark is therefore massless in this approach, though higher order mass
effects can be included in the calculation. A critical review of the
different flavour number schemes and of the status of theoretical
calculations is available in Ref.~\cite{Maltoni:2012pa}. The two approaches
give identical results to all orders in perturbation theory, but they can be
different at finite order. In the 4F scheme the computation is more
complicate, but the full kinematics of the heavy quarks is taken into
account. Furthermore it can be easily interfaced to parton showers, even at
NLO using the \MCatNLO~\cite{Frixione:2002ik} or the
POWHEG~\cite{Nason:2004rx} formalisms.  On the other hand logarithms in the
initial state are not resummed and could lead to large discrepancies in the
inclusive quantities like the total cross-section. In the 5F approach, on the
opposite, calculations for the inclusive quantities are highly simplified and
generally more accurate, but differential distributions and exclusive
observables are technically more involved.

The goal of this study is to compare the most recent measurements with the
predictions of the state of the art generators using 4F and 5F scheme. The
report is organised as follows. In Section \ref{rivet} we provide a short
description of the ATLAS and CMS measurements, available in the Rivet
framework, for $V+b+X$ and $V+b\bar{b}+X$, where $V$ is a $Z$ or a $W$ boson.
In Section \ref{generators} we describe the generator setups used to obtain
the predictions, which are compared to the measurements in Section \ref{Zbb}
for the $Z$ and \ref{Wbb} for the $W$, before conclusions are drawn in
Section \ref{concl}.


\subsection{Rivet Routines \label{rivet}}

Results in this study were produced using three Rivet routines to compare to
published ATLAS and CMS data.

\begin{itemize}
\item Measurement of differential production cross-sections for a $Z$\ boson
  in association with b-jets in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} =
  7$~TeV with the ATLAS detector~\cite{Aad:2014dvb} (Rivet routine
  ATLAS\_2014\_I1306294). A pair of opposite sign charge dressed
  leptons\footnote{Leptons are dressed by adding the four-vectors of all
    photons within $\Delta R<0.1$\ to the lepton 4-vector} (i.e. electrons or
  muons) with $\pt>20$~GeV and $|\eta|<2.5$ are required, with a dilepton
  mass between 76 and 106~GeV. Anti-k$_{t}$\ 0.4 jets are reconstructed from
  all final state particles, and required to have $\pt>$20~GeV, $|y|<2.4$ and
  not overlap with the leptons used to make the $Z$~candidate ($\Delta R(jet,
  l)> 0.5$). Jets are labelled as $b$-jets based on matching with $\Delta
  R<0.3$ to a weakly decaying $b$-hadron with $\pt>5$~GeV.

  Distributions include the \pt and rapidity of $b$-jets and of the
  $Z$-boson, and for each $b$-jet, the $y_{boost}$ of the $b$-jet and
  $Z$. For events with $Z\, \pt>20$~GeV, the $\Delta R, \Delta\phi$, and
  $\Delta y$\ between the $Z$ and all $b$-jets are plotted. For events with
  at least two $b$-jets, the $\Delta R$\ and di-$b$-jet mass for the two
  leading $b$-jets, along with the $Z$ \pt and rapidity are plotted.

  For this study, further distributions were added: the \pt of all weakly
  decaying $b$ hadrons with $|y|<2.7$, and the \pt of the subset of those
  that are matched to a jet. For $b$-jets, the number of matching
  $b$-hadrons, and the jet \pt for jets with one or two matching $b$-hadrons
  are plotted, all with and without the 5~GeV requirement on $b$-hadron
  \pt. Finally the ratio of the number of jets matching one to those matching
  two $b$-hadrons is plotted as a function of jet \pt. All of these
  additional distributions are also formed using $b$-quarks instead of
  $b$-hadrons.
  
\item Measurement of the cross-section for W boson production in association
  with b-jets in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV with the ATLAS
  detector~\cite{Aad:2013vka} (Rivet routine ATLAS\_2013\_I1219109). A
  dressed lepton with $\pt>25$~GeV and $|\eta|<2.5$\ and a same-flavour
  neutrino with $\pt>25$~GeV are used to form a $W$~candidate, which is
  required to have a transverse mass greater than $60$~GeV. Anti-k$_{t}$\ 0.4
  jets are reconstructed from all final state particles, and required to have
  $\pt>$25~GeV, $|y|<2.1$ and not overlap with the charged lepton used to
  make the $W$~candidate ($\Delta R(jet, l)> 0.5$). Events with more than two
  selected jets are vetoed, and the at least one of the selected jets is
  required to be labelled as $b$-jet, based on matching with $\Delta R<0.3$
  to a weakly decaying $b$-hadron with $\pt>5$~GeV.

  Distributions include the number of $b$-jets, and the $b$-jet \pt in events
  containing exactly one or two selected jets. The same additional
  distributions for the $Z$ analysis are also added to this analysis.
  
\item Cross-section and angular correlations in $Z$ boson with b-hadrons
  events at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV~\cite{Chatrchyan:2013zja} (Rivet routine
  CMS\_2013\_i1256943). A pair of opposite sign charge dressed lepton with
  $\pt>20$~GeV and $|\eta|<2.4$ are required, with dilepton mass between 81
  and 101~GeV. Exactly two weakly decaying b-hadrons with $\pt>15$~GeV and
  $|\eta|<2$\ are then required.

  Distributions include the $Z$\ \pt, the $\Delta R$\ and
  $\Delta\phi$\ between $b$-hadrons, $\Delta R$\ between the $Z$ and closest
  $b$-hadron, and the asymmetry of the $\Delta R$\ between the $Z$ and
  closest $b$-hadron, and the $Z$\ and the furthest $b$-hadron. The angular
  distributions are repeated with a requirement of $Z$\ $\pt>50$~GeV.


\end{itemize}



\subsection{Event generators \label{generators}}

\subsubsection{\protect\Sherpa }
In this section we present results obtained with the \Sherpa event
generator~\cite{Gleisberg:2008ta}. In particular we consider three different
classes of samples: 4F~\MCatNLO, 5F~\MEPS and a 5F~\MEPSatNLO one.
\begin{itemize}
\item[4F \MCatNLO : ]{ This first set of results is obtained in the
  four-flavour scheme, and based on the \MCatNLO
  technique~\cite{Frixione:2002ik}, as implemented in
  \Sherpa~\cite{Hoeche:2011fd}. In a four-flavour scheme calculation,
  $b$--quarks can only be produced as final state massive particles. They
  are, therefore, completely decoupled from the evolution of the strong
  coupling, $\alpha_S$ and that of the PDFs. In this scheme the associated
  production at tree-level starts from processes such as $jj \to b\bar{b}Z$
  where $j$ can be either a light quark or a gluon. No specific cuts are
  applied on the $b$--quarks, their finite mass regulates collinear
  divergences that would appear in the massless case. In most cases,
  therefore, a $b$-jet actually originates from the parton shower evolution
  and hadronization of a $b$--quark produced by the matrix element.}
\item[5F~\MEPS :]{ In a 5F scheme $b$--quarks are treated as massless
  partons. Collinear logs are resummed into a $b$--PDF and they can appear as
  initial state particles as well as final state ones. In order to account
  for 0 and 1 $b$--jets bins as well as to cure the collinear singularity
  that would arise with a massless final state parton, we use multi-jet
  merging. In \Sherpa, the well-established mechanism for combining into one
  inclusive sample towers of matrix elements with increasing jet multiplicity
  at tree--\-level is the CKKW~\cite{Catani:2001cc}.  For this sample we
  merge together LO samples of $jj \to Z$, $jj \to Z+j$, $jj \to Z+jj$, $jj
  \to Z+jjj$ where now $j$ can be a light quark, a $b$--quark or a gluon, and
  all these samples are further matched to the \Sherpa parton shower
  \CSS~\cite{Schumann:2007mg}.  Merging rests on a jet-criterion, applied to
  the matrix elements.  As a result, jets are being produced by the
  fixed--order matrix elements and further evolved by the parton shower.  As
  a consequence, the jet criterion separating the two regimes is typically
  chosen such that the jets produced by the shower are softer than the jets
  entering the analysis.  This is realised here by a cut-off of $\mu_{\rm
    jet}\,=\, 10 $ GeV.}
	
\item[5F~\MEPSatNLO : ]{ In this scheme we use the extension to next--to
  leading order matrix elements, in a technique dubbed
  \MEPSatNLO~\cite{Hoeche:2012yf}.  In particular, we merge $jj \to Z$, $jj
  \to Z+j$, $jj \to Z+jj$ calculated with NLO accuracy and we further merge
  this sample with $jj \to Z+jjj$ at the LO.  As in the previous case
  matching criterion has to be chosen, and this is realised by a cut-off of
  $\mu_{\rm jet}\,=\, 10 $ GeV.}
\end{itemize}
In \Sherpa, tree--\-level cross sections are provided by two matrix element
generators, \Amegic~\cite{Krauss:2001iv} and \Comix~\cite{Gleisberg:2008fv},
which also implement the automated infrared
subtraction~\cite{Gleisberg:2007md} through the Catani--\-Seymour
scheme~\cite{Catani:1996vz,Catani:2002hc}.  For parton showering, the
implementation of~\cite{Schumann:2007mg} is employed with the difference that
for $g\to b\bar{b}$ splittings the invariant mass of the $b\bar{b}$ pair,
instead of their transverse momentum, is being used as scale.  NLO matrix
elements are instead obtained from \OpenLoops~\cite{Cascioli:2011va,
  Cascioli:2014wya}.

\subsubsection{\Herwig}
In this section we present the setup for those results obtained with the
\Herwig event generator~\cite{Bellm:2015jjp,Bahr:2008pv}.

Based on extensions of the previously developed \Matchbox
module~\cite{Platzer:2011bc}, \Herwig facilitates the automated setup of all
ingredients necessary for a full NLO QCD calculation in the subtraction
formalism: an implementation of the Catani--Seymour dipole subtraction
method~\cite{Catani:1996vz,Catani:2002hc}, as well as interfaces to a list of
external matrix--element providers -- either at the level of squared matrix
elements, based on extensions of the BLHA
standard~\cite{Binoth:2010xt,Alioli:2013nda,Andersen:2014efa}, or at the
level of color--ordered subamplitudes, where the color bases are provided by
an interface to the \ColorFull~\cite{Sjodahl:2014opa} and
\CVolver~\cite{Platzer:2013fha} libraries.

For this study the relevant tree--level matrix elements are provided by
\MadGraph\_\MCatNLO~\cite{Alwall:2011uj,Alwall:2014hca} (at the level of
color--ordered subamplitudes), whereas the relevant tree--level/one--loop
interference terms are provided by
\OpenLoops~\cite{Cascioli:2011va,Cascioli:2014wya} (at the level of squared
matrix elements).

Fully automated NLO matching algorithms are available, henceforth referred to
as subtractive (NLO$\oplus$) and multiplicative (NLO$\otimes$) matching --
based on the MC@NLO~\cite{Frixione:2002ik} and POWHEG~\cite{Nason:2004rx}
formalism respectively -- for the systematic and consistent combination of
NLO QCD calculations with both shower
variants~\cite{Gieseke:2003rz,Platzer:2009jq} in \Herwig.

We consider four different classes of samples, for varying combinations of
matching and shower algorithms (a selection of plots can be found in sections
\ref{sec:ZHerwig} and \ref{sec:WHerwig}):
\begin{itemize}
\item[4F, Zbb] For this set we consider the subtractive and multiplicative
  matching together with the $\tilde{q}$ shower.  The core tree--level
  process in this case is $jj \to Z b\bar{b} \to l^+ l^- b\bar{b}$, where $l
  \in \{e, \mu\}$. For the production runs only $l=e$ is actually considered.
  In a four--flavour scheme the $b$ quark is typically considered massive and
  $j$ can only consist of light quarks or a gluon, not a $b$ quark.
\item[5F, Zbb] For this set we consider the subtractive and multiplicative
  matching together with the $\tilde{q}$ and dipole shower.  The core
  tree--level process in this case is $jj \to Z b\bar{b} \to l^+ l^-
  b\bar{b}$, where $l \in \{e, \mu\}$. For the production runs only $l=e$ is
  actually considered.  In a five--flavour scheme the $b$ quark is treated as
  massless, and $j$ may also include a $b$ quark.  Generator--level cuts on
  the $b$ quarks have thus been applied.  Only in the shower evolution of the
  $\tilde{q}$ shower is the $b$ quark assumed massive.
\item[5F, Zb] For this set we consider the subtractive and multiplicative
  matching together with the $\tilde{q}$ and dipole shower.  The core
  tree--level process in this case is $jj_b \to Z j_b \to l^+ l^- j_b$, where
  $l \in \{e, \mu\}$. For the production runs only $l=e$ is actually
  considered.  In a five--flavour scheme the $b$ quark is treated as
  massless.  For single $b$--quark production $j$ must not include a $b$
  quark, but $j_b \in \{b,\bar{b}\}$.  Generator--level cuts on the $b$ quark
  have thus been applied.  Only in the shower evolution of the $\tilde{q}$
  shower is the $b$ quark assumed massive.
\item[4F, Wbb] For this set we consider the subtractive and multiplicative
  matching together with the $\tilde{q}$ shower.  The core tree--level
  process in this case is $jj' \to W b\bar{b} \to l \nu_l b\bar{b}$, where $l
  \in \{e^+, e^-, \mu^+, \mu^-\}$ and $\nu_l$ the associated neutrino.  In a
  four--flavour scheme the $b$ quark is typically considered massive and
  $j,j'$ can only consist of light quarks or a gluon, not a $b$ quark.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Z+b(b) production \label{Zbb}}

\subsubsection{Z+b(b) with \Sherpa}

Figures~\ref{zbb-sherpa-atlas} and ~\ref{zbb-sherpa-cms} show a selection of
the plots comparing Sherpa predictions to data.  There is overall a good
agreement, but for the normalization. The 5F LO order predictions are
generally below the data, though compatible within the large scale
uncertainty. For NLO predictions this uncertainty is smaller and some
patterns can be observed. Both the 5F and the 4F NLO are in good agreement
with distributions for events with two b-tagged jets.  But when a single
b-jet is tagged, the 5F and 4F results have an opposite behaviour: the 5F is
~20\% above the data (except for high $Z$ \pt), while 4F is ~20\% below.

It is nevertheless remarkable that the ratio of 4F NLO predictions to data is
flat for all the observables. This is particularly interesting, since it is
more efficient to generate a sample of $Z+b\bar{b}$ events with the 4F scheme
than with the 5F. The reason why an overall normalization factor is needed
could lie in the large logarithms, that in the 5F scheme are resummed in the
$b$ parton distribution function. However they might not affect the shape of
the distributions. To check this hypothesis the 4F NLO predictions have been
rescaled to the best available inclusive cross-sections {\em
  FIXME:UNCERTAINTY BAND/REFERENCES}. A selection of the plots is shown in
Figure~\ref{zbb-sherpa-scaled}. The results are very encouraging but further
studies are needed to understand if this approach fails for other
observables, e.g. those related to the presence of additional light-quark
jets.

\subsection{W+b production}
\label{sec:Wbb}

\subsubsection{W+b with POWHEG}
All the details of the analysis performed using the {\tt Wbbj} code in the
\POWHEGBOX{} framework can be found in ref.~\cite{Luisoni:2015mpa}. Here we
briefly summarize them.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We have used a mixed renormalization scheme~\cite{Collins:1978wz},
  generally known as decoupling scheme, in which the $n_{\rm lf}$ light flavours
  are subtracted in the usual \MSB{} scheme, while the heavy-flavour loop is
  subtracted at zero momentum. In this scheme, the heavy flavour decouples at
  low energies. To make contact with other results expressed in terms of the
  $\MSB$ strong coupling constant, running with 5 light flavours, and with
  pdfs with 5 flavours, we have switched our scheme using the procedure
  discussed in ref.~\cite{Cacciari:1998it}.

\item We have generated $Wb\bar{b}j$ events using the
  \MINLO~\cite{Hamilton:2012np} prescription, that attaches a suitable
  Sudakov form factor to the $Wb\bar{b}j$ cross section at NLO, and subtracts
  its expansion (not to have double counting of the Sudakov logarithms), in
  order to get a finite cross section down to small transverse momentum of
  the hardest jet.  The scales of the primary process (i.e.~the process
  obtained by the attempt to cluster a $Wb\bar{b}j$ event with a procedure
  similar to CKKW~\cite{Catani:2001cc}) have been chosen as follows:

  \vspace{2mm}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item if there has been a clusterization, then the scales are set to
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:Wbb_scales}
        \mur=\muf= \mu\equiv\frac{\sqrt{\hat{s}}}{4}\,, \qquad\hat{s} = (p_{\sss\rm W}
        + p_{\sss\rm b}+p_{\sss\rm \bar b})^2,
      \end{equation}
      where $p_{\sss \rm W}$, $p_{\sss \rm b}$ and $p_{\sss\rm \bar b}$
      are the momenta of the $W$, $b$ and $\bar{b}$ in the primary process
    \item If the event has not been clustered by the \MINLO{} procedure,
      i.e.~if the underlying Born $Wb\bar{b}j$ process is not clustered by
      \MINLO{}, we take as scale the partonic center-of-mass energy of the
      event.      
  \end{enumerate}
  \vspace{2mm}
  
The bands in the plots of Figs.~\ref{fig:wbb-njet-powheg}
and~\ref{fig:wbb-pt-powheg} of this section are the envelope of the
distributions obtained by varying the renormalization and factorization
scales by a factor of 2 around the reference scale $\mu$ of
eq.~(\ref{eq:Wbb_scales}), i.e.~by multiplying the factorization and the
renormalization scale by the scale factors $\KFA$ and $\KRA$, respectively,
where
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:KRA_KFA}
(\KRA,\KFA)=(0.5,0.5),  (0.5,1), (1,0.5), (1,1),(2,1),(1,2),(2,2).
\end{equation}
These variations have been computed using the \POWHEGBOX{} reweighting
procedure, that recomputes the weight associated with an event in a fast way.
